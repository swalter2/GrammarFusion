## *** Major changes after the Year1 review and 3rd technical meeting ***                 ##
## (following the suggestions of P. Cimiano):                                             ##
## - When considering partial matches between the groundtruth and induced                 ##
##   fragments, consider the Levenshtein distance in order to find the best               ##
##   matches.                                                                             ##
##   That is, when no exact match can be found, which is the best partial match.          ##
##   The best match has the smallest Levenshtein distance.                                ##
##   The best matches are used when the under- and over-induction are considered.         ##
## - Note the following:                                                                  ##
##   -- For precision computation: allow any single groundtruth fragment to               ##
##   stand as the best match (even) for MULTIPLE INDUCED fragments.                       ##
##   That is, to do NOT require one-to-one mapping.                                       ##
##   -- For recall computation: allow any single induced fragment to                      ##
##   stand as the best match (even) for MULTIPLE GROUNDTRUTH fragmants.                   ##
